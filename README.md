Requirements

Requires iPhone OS SDK 3.0 or greater. Note the code has not been tested with the iPad simulator yet.

Status
======

The project is usable but more testing is needed.  Also, some of the Photo.app behaviors still have not been implemented.

TO DO
-----

* Make show and hide photo viewer chrome behave like the Photos app.
* Document "how to use" instructions.
* Need to improve the performance of the sample photo data source.
